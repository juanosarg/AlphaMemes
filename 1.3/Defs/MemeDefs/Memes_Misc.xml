We take this vow to be nonviolent in our thoughts, our speech, and our actions.\n\n&lt;color=#33d733&gt;This is a very challenging meme, as ALL colonists of this ideoligion will be incapable of combat, and can only defend themselves in three ways: traps, turrets, and having a multi-ideo colony with some "defenders" who don't share the same values.&lt;/color&gt;\n\nOskar quote: "please no xd this is actually game breaking".</description>
