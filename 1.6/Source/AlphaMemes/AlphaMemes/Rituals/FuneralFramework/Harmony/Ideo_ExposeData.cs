            //I cant stop it, without also doing something that would break the ability for other modders myself included to have their rituals automatically added when someone adds mod
            //Eg Persona Bond Ritual; Where I thought it wouldnt work without a new save or at least reform. I now know it worked because of this.
            //So it's a dilema because having AlsoAdd Rituals that aren't visible opens up a tonne of possilibites, but I have to resolve this because it causes nasty annoying bugs otherwise.
            //Much digging later, the PreceptDef field canGenerateAsSpecialPrecept is the safest bet. It's default to true, and is how all the autoinclude rituals are setup.
            //Specifically canGenerateAsSpecialPrecept == true && countsTowardsPreceptLimit == False
            //This is also why it would add all of my funerals every time. I copied base funeral, which is actually always added because of the above.
            //canGenerateAsSpecialPrecept = false is what base nocorpse does to avoid the autoadd in random generation.
            //In this expose data it avoids autoadd with the takeNameFrom. Which is not useable for my purposes.
            //So that's what I'm adding as the extra criteria. It shouldnt hurt any modders as if they wanted it to be autoadd to ideo. Then it has to be true for it to work at all for them. (Barring some silliniess with harmony but hopefully no one is doing that)
