				<li>atheismlessonIntro->... thus what is wanted are blindness and intoxication and an eternal song over the waves in which reason has drowned. The objective of religion is clear, hiding to us that</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->Human decency is not derived from religion. It precedes it. Once you understand that it becomes clear:</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->Atheism is more than just the knowledge that gods do not exist, and that religion is either a mistake or a fraud. Atheism is an attitude. It teaches us one thing:</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet. The more controlled they are the longer it takes them to realize that</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->There is something infantile in the presumption that somebody else has a responsibility to give your life meaning and point. Only you can realize that</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->Being a Humanist means trying to behave decently without expectation of rewards or punishment after you are dead. You will show everyone that</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->When one person suffers from a delusion, it is called insanity. When many people suffer from a delusion it is called a Religion. Only those who are free from magical thinking can see that</li>
				<li>atheismlessonIntro->I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that</li>
				<!-- generic reinforcement -->
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->We can judge our progress by the courage of our questions and the depth of our answers, our willingness to embrace what is true rather than what feels good.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->The more I learn about the universe, the less convinced I am that there's any sort of benevolent force that has anything to do with it, at all.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->After coming into contact with a religious man I always feel I must wash my hands.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->I don't want to believe. I want to know.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->With or without religion, good people can behave well and bad people can do evil; but for good people to do evil - that takes religion.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->Civilization will not attain to its perfection until the last stone from the last church falls on the last priest.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->We must question the story logic of having an all-knowing all-powerful God, who creates faulty Humans, and then blames them for his own mistakes.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->If there is a God, atheism must seem to Him as less of an insult than religion.</li>
				<li>atheismlessonReinforcement->When people ask me if a god created the universe, I tell them that the question itself makes no sense.</li>

				<li>jewishlessonIntro->Do not seek revenge or bear a grudge against anyone among your people, but love your neighbor as yourself. I am the LORD. I want you to understand:</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->Then Moses said, 'Now show me your glory.' And the Lord said, 'I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim my name, the Lord, in your presence. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.' This teaches us that</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you; the LORD turn his face toward you and give you peace. The LORD did teach me one thing:</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->By teaching the Torah on the [place_summary] [place_name], I realized that</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->God is not a human, that he should lie, not a human being, that he should change his mind. Does he speak and then not act? Does he promise and not fulfill? You will realize that</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth. He was teaching that</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one's life. One thing will become increasingly clear then: that</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->Any man or woman who wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the Lord is guilty and must confess the sin they have committed. Then they'll see that</li>
				<li>jewishlessonIntro->In your unfailing love, you will lead the people you have redeemed. In your strength, you will guide them to your holy dwelling. Once that is achieved you will see that</li>

				<li>jewlessonReinforcement->I don't speak because I have the power to speak; I speak because I don't have the power to remain silent.</li>
				<li>jewlessonReinforcement->There are no problems, only opportunities for growth.</li>
				<li>jewlessonReinforcement->The salvation of God is like the blink of an eye.</li>

				<li>jainistlessonIntro->In happiness and suffering, in joy and grief, we should regard all creatures as we regard our own self. This teaches us that</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->Some foolish men declare that a creator made the world. The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before the creation? These musings did teach me one thing:</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->By teaching the sacred Agamas on the [place_summary] [place_name], I realized that</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->May peace rule the universe; may peace rule in kingdoms and empires; may peace rule in states and in the lands of the potentates; may peace rule in the house of friends and may peace also rule in the house of enemies. In peace you will realize that</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->We preach and practice brotherhood — not only of man but of all living beings — not on Sundays only but on all the days of the week. We believe in the law of universal justice. We preach that</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->If a person's mind is controlled by forces of revenge and jealousy, it cannot express love and sympathy. One thing will become increasingly clear then: that</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->A man is seated on top of a tree in the midst of a burning forest. He sees all living beings perish. But he doesn’t realize that the same fate is soon to overtake him also. That man is a fool. He needs to realize that</li>
				<li>jainistlessonIntro->Attachment and aversion are the root cause of karma, and karma originates from infatuation. Karma is the root cause of birth and death, and these are said to be the source of misery. None can escape the effect of their own past karma. Once you free yourself from attachment you will see that</li>
				<!-- generic reinforcement -->
				<li>jainlessonReinforcement->Live and allow others to live; hurt no one; life is dear to all living beings.</li>
				<li>jainlessonReinforcement->By sincerity, a man gains physical, mental and linguistic straightforwardness, and harmonious tendency; that is, congruence of speech and action.</li>
				<li>jainlessonReinforcement->All souls are equal and alike and have the similar nature and qualities.</li>
