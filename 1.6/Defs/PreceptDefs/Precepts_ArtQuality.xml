There is no valid excuse for shoddily executed art, and we shouldn't have to suffer it.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt;\n - Colonists with "High" expectations or higher will demand high quality art. Art quality will be averaged between all art pieces present in the colony.</description>
