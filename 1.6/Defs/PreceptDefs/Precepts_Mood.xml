				<label>spiders in my face</label>
				<description>Did you know you swallow at least two spiders every night? I enjoy it. They taste like cinnamon.</description>

				<label>clown in the sky looking at me</label>
				<description>There is a stern-looking clown dressed like a pirate looking at me, licking his lips. It craves my attention.</description>

			<li>
				<label>liquorice tastes like betrayal</label>
				<description>I have been betrayed by my fiercest enemy: croutons. They will be slaughtered by the thousands.</description>

			<li>
				<label>the voices won't stop</label>
				<description>They could be telling me to kill everyone, but instead they recite stock exchange transactions in ancient languages. A beet smiles upon my portfolio.</description>

			<li>
				<label>I feel like turpentine</label>
				<description>It's a slick feeling, like a raspy cat's tongue licking the inside of my organs. It reminds me of my grandma's stew.</description>

			<li>
				<label>all cheese is obnoxious</label>
				<description>Specially blue cheese. It refuses to let other people talk and interrupts constantly.</description>

			<li>
				<label>have you ever seen tomorrow?</label>
				<description>It's blue. All blue. With hints of a colour that is between stygian blue and hyperbolic orange.</description>

			<li>
				<label>I can feel the inside of my skin</label>
				<description>It feels like home. I can even see the fireplace burning with the smell of freshly baked kerosene.</description>
				<baseMoodEffect>10</baseMoodEffect>
			</li>
			<li>
				<label>my flesh vessel is itchy</label>
				<description>It burns.</description>
