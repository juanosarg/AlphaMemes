    <description>By properly cataloguing all the genetically modified animals on the Rim we are contributing to making the galaxy a better place.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt;\n - Colonists with "Low" expectations or higher will receive increasing mood boosts from the number of animals scanned and stored in the animal database. You need to have a database built for this to work. Animals that have been analyzed will get a bonus to filth rate, caravan riding speed and minimum handling skill needed to tame and train them.</description>
